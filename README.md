# liri-node-app
First Node App

The biggest issue I had with the Node app was getting my secret keys to connect from the .env => to keys.js => liri.js. Because of this, I have had a huge problem seeing what other issues exist in my app. Since I can't connect to the API's I can see how my code properly works.
